<p>     Registration for an account on this site requires only a valid e-mail 
  address and a user name that has not been chosen already. You are not required to provide
  any other information if you do not want to. Please be aware that the user name you choose, the 
e-mail address you provide and any other information you enter may render you personally identifiable,
 and may possibly be displayed on this web site intentionally (depending on choices you make during the registration
 process, or depending on the way in which the site is configured) or unintentionally (subsequent to a successful act
 of intrusion by a third party). As on many web sites, the site editor may also automatically receive general information
 that is contained in server log files, such as your IP address, and cookie information. Information about how 
advertising may be served on this site (if it is indeed the site editor policy to display advertising) is set forth below.</p>

<p>     Data may be used to customize and improve your user experience on this site. 
Efforts will be made to prevent your data being made available to third parties unless
 (i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy; (ii) your consent is obtained, such as
 when you choose to opt-in or opt-out for the sharing of data; (iii) a service provided on our site 
requires interaction with a third party, or is provided by a third party, such as an application service provider;
 (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; (v) it is found that your use of this site violates the site editor policy,
 terms of service, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by the site editor to protect the site editor legal
 rights and/or property; or (vi) this site is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able to use the data in the
 same manner as set forth in this policy. In the event you choose to use links displayed on this web site to visit other web sites, you are
